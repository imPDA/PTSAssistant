Helps you to find things on PTS:
- shows in what container you can find what thing;
- can automatically retrieve them and all containers in between.

Open inventory, type in search box to filter and double (or right) click to retrieve item. If item already in the inventory, it will not be looted again.

It was created over one night, so a couple iterations needed to make it more stable. If you encounter any bug, please report. I would aslo be glad to receive suggestions!

[COLOR="Olive"][B]Known issues[/B][/COLOR]
- Can fail to retrieve items if some container in the middle of chain is absent. All further actions will fail.
- Do not search over bank or over equipped items, which can lead to false results
