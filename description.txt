[SIZE="6"][B]PTS Assistant[/B][/SIZE]

Helps you to find things on PTS:
- shows in what container you can find what thing;
- can automatically retrieve them and all containers in between.

Slash command `/ptsassistant` to show or hide the main window, type in search box to filter and right click to retrieve.

It was created over one night, so a couple iterations needed to make it more stable. If you encounter any bug, please report. I would aslo be glad to receive suggestions!

[COLOR="Olive"][B]Known issues[/B][/COLOR]
- Can fail to retrieve items if some container in the middle of chain is absent. All further actions will fail.
- Do not search over bank or over equipped items, which can lead to false results
